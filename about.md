Hello everybody!

I'm currently working as a sysadmin and if you're one too, you'll know that we are welcomed with new issues to solve on a daily basis.

You'll also know how frustrating can be looking for some straight-to-the-point answers to your questions and having to search the internet for hours in order to get what you need.

This blog was born with the purpose of gathering quick tips about things I had to figure out by putting together fragmented pieces of information lying around on the internet
